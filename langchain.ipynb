      "The time it takes for a human to build an AI model can vary widely depending on the complexity of the model, the quality and availability of data, the expertise of the person building the model, and the resources available to them.\n",

      "For a simple AI model, such as a linear regression or a decision tree, a skilled data scientist with high-quality data and access to powerful computing resources might be able to build and train a model in a matter of hours or days. However, for more complex models, such as deep neural networks, the process can take weeks or even months, especially if the data is noisy or sparse.\n",
